# htmlspecialchars_decode
[View on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlspecialchars_decode)
## What is htmlspecialchars_decode?
htmlspecialchars_decode is used to decode html entities! This is very useful if, like me, you have to insert things in a php database with the `htmlspecialchars()` function and you want to retrieve them in Javascript but in a decoded format ...
<br>
## How to install?
```javascript
npm i htmlspecialchars_decode
```
<br>

## Now, how to use?!
It's very simple

```javascript
const htmlspecialchars_decode = require('htmlspecialchars_decode');

let msg = "&amp; &lt; &quot;";

console.log(msg)

// And now, with the module!
console.log(htmlspecialchars_decode(msg))
```

I hope I would have helped you ^^
